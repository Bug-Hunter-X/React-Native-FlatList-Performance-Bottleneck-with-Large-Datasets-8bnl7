In React Native, an uncommon error occurs when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item renderers.  The error is not always immediately obvious; it often manifests as slow rendering, dropped frames, or even app crashes.  The root cause is usually inefficient rendering or excessive re-renders of list items. For example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <ComplexComponent item={item} />
  )}
/>
```

`ComplexComponent` might perform expensive calculations or updates within its render method, causing performance bottlenecks.  This is exacerbated by the fact that `FlatList` re-renders items when they scroll off and back onto the screen, potentially triggering repeated, expensive operations.
